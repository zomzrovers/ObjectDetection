# Object_Detection-using ResNet50

Object detection is fundamental in computer vision, crucial for automatically locating and categorizing objects within images or video frames. This study explores the application of deep learning techniques, particularly utilizing the ResNet50 architecture, to enhance the precision and computational efficiency of object detection tasks. By employing transfer learning and optimizing ResNet50 on annotated datasets, significant improvements in detection accuracy and speed were achieved. Findings include detailed performance metrics such as mean Average Precision (mAP) and processing time comparisons across different object detection frameworks. Plots illustrate the effectiveness of the ResNet50-based model in real-world scenarios, demonstrating its potential impact on fields ranging from autonomous systems to surveillance and image retrieval.
