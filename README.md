# Object Detection using ResNet50

Object detection is a cornerstone of computer vision, enabling systems to identify and localize objects in images or videos. This project explores an efficient approach to object detection using the **ResNet50** architecture, leveraging deep learning and transfer learning techniques.

## Overview

This project aims to:
- Employ the ResNet50 convolutional neural network for object detection.
- Utilize transfer learning to adapt the model to custom or benchmark object detection datasets.
- Evaluate model performance based on **mean Average Precision (mAP)** and **inference speed**.
- Compare ResNet50-based detection results with other common frameworks.

ResNet50 is used as a feature extractor integrated into an object detection pipeline (e.g., using Faster R-CNN or a custom head), offering a strong trade-off between accuracy and speed.
